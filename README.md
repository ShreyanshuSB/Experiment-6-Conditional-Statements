# Aim

To study and implement conditional statements in Python for decision-making and logical operations.

# Objectives

To understand the concept of decision making in Python

To learn the use of if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements

To apply conditional statements for solving real-life logical problems

To analyze program flow based on conditions

# Theory

Conditional statements in Python are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. These statements evaluate a Boolean expression and execute a block of code if the condition is true.

Types of Conditional Statements

if statement
Executes a block of code only if the condition is true.

if-else statement
Executes one block if the condition is true and another block if it is false.

if-elif-else statement
Used when multiple conditions need to be checked sequentially.

Applications of Conditional Statements

Checking whether a number is positive, negative, or zero

Finding even or odd numbers

Comparing numbers to find the largest value

Determining leap years

Calculating salary, tax, or grades based on conditions

Conditional statements improve program logic, control flow, and decision-making capability.

# Conclusion

Thus, the experiment was successfully performed and the concept of conditional statements in Python was studied. Different decision-making constructs such as if, if-else, and if-elif-else were implemented using practical examples. This experiment helped in understanding how Python handles logical conditions and controls the flow of execution in a program
